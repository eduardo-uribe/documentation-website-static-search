`<static-search>`

A web component that provides text-search without server-side code or database. You can support this open-source project by giving it a star on [Github](https://github.com/eduardo-uribe/static-search).

## Start Using

`<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/eduardo-uribe/static-search/static-search.js"</script>`

We add the above `<script>` HTML element to embed the executable JavaScript code. The `<script>`'s `src` attribute value specifies the URL of the external JavaScript code.
